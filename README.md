In this project, we want to know if emojis are used differently by different personas. The main two categories of analysis are 1) gender: males/females, and 2) age: young/old. However, this can include other factors, such as countries, languages, and popularity on social media.
</br>
</br>
For each group of persona, the following analysis to be applied:
</br>
1) Percentage of usage of emojis in each group

2) Top used emojis

3) Used in communication (replies, mentions) or in general posts

4) Topics of usage
</br>
</br>Once the analysis is performed, the next step will be building models for recommending emojis to social media users in their posts.
</br>
</br>
The work steps contain the following:

1) Collecting millions of tweets with emojis in English at least (Twitter API)

2) Applying one of the state-of-the-art methods for gender and age estimation of Twitter users

3) Performing statistical analysis for data

4) Building emojis usage models for recommendation
