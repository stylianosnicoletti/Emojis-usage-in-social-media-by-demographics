# Emojis-usage-in-social-media-by-demographics
In this project, we want to know if emojis are used differently by different personas. The main two categories of analysis are 1) gender: males/females, and 2) age: young/old. However, this can include other factors, such as countries, languages, and popularity on social media.
</br>
</br>
For each group of persona, the following analysis to be applied:
</br>
</br>
Percentage of usage of emojis in each group
</br>
Top used emojis
</br>
Used in communication (replies, mentions) or in general posts
</br>
Topics of usage

</br>Once the analysis is performed, the next step will be building models for recommending emojis to social media users in their posts.
</br>
The work steps contain the following:
</br>
</br>
Collecting millions of tweets with emojis in English at least, (Twitter API to be used)
</br>
Applying one of the state-of-the-art methods for gender and age estimation of Twitter users
</br>
Performing statistical analysis for data
</br>
Building emojis usage models for recommendation
